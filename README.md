# Task planner

A simple to-do list web application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS â€” developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum.

## Description

This project is a dynamic task management app where users can create, organize, and manage their to-dos. The main goal was to practice modular JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and data persistence using `localStorage`.

Users can add tasks, group them into projects, set due dates, and mark them as complete. All data is saved locally, ensuring that to-dos persist between sessions.

## Features

- Modular JavaScript with ES6 modules
- Fully interactive UI generated via DOM manipulation
- Project-based task organization
- Due dates and task priority support
- Local storage integration for data persistence
- Clean, responsive UI styled with custom CSS
- Built and served using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and hot module replacement
